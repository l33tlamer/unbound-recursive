# Unbound-Recursive

Simple Docker image for Unbound as recursive DNS resolver

**This is heavily based on mvance/unbound, all credit to them.**

This is simply for personal use to have a more up-to-date version of Unbound.

As at your own risk, i provide no support at all.

Image is available at Docker Hub: `l33tlamer/unbound-recursive`
